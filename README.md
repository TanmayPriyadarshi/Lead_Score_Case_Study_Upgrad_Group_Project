# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

## Objective

This project is the case study on the problem from X Education company, which sells online courses to the professionals.
Their problem is that, only 30% of the applicants are getting converted.
So, a solution is demanded to acquire a conversion rate of 80%.
In this project we have tried to implement a model based on Logistic regression to achieve the above goal.

## Details of files given

For this project we have following documents to build and support our case study: -
- Lead Scoring Case Study_Final_Version.ipynb : Assignment Python Notebook file.
- Lead Scoring PPT Final.pdf : presentation file
- Assignment Subjective Questions_Final_Version.pdf: Subject Question Solution file
- Summary_Report_Final.pdf : Summary Report of project

## Steps Followed

This project case study is useful for all such platforms which are dealing with lot of applicants on the platform but a much smaller customer conversion rate e.g., let’s say people tend to try a free trial but won’t go for the paid version. It is hard for the companies to find potential customers.
This is how we have approached to the solution:
1.	Reading data dictionary
2.	Loading dataframe
3.	Treating null values with either imputing or dropping them
4.	Performing EDA
5.	Finding best features by using hybrid technique (RFE + Manual)
6.	Building Logistic Regression model
7.	Re-building after checking for multicollinearity 
8.	Deploying on test dataframe
9.	Evaluating model
10.	Drawing conclusions from results

This case study is built by a group of three students of a master’s program.
